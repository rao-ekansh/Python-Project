In this Python project , our goal is to build a game in which user can check and even improve typing speed. 
For a graphical user interface, we will be going to use the pygame library in Python which is used for working with graphics.
This is an OOPs approach. We will also show the images and text required to be displayed on the screen as per our need.
Interesting FACT : You Can Save 21 days per Year with effective skills!

Technology Used :

Language - Python 
Software - Jupyter Notebook
Platform - MacOS


Prerequisites and Libraries need to be installed :

1. First of all you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming language .   
2. You should have to install the PyGame; library using the following command : 
pip install pygame.

You should have to know the working of random , time and sys package and knowledge of —— Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Python . 

3. This project broadly consists of two types of file :

essay.txt - A text file consisting a number of sentences in which we will pick one of the sentence randomly and give it to the user as challenge.
TypingSpeedTest.py - The main python program file consisting all the codes.
Note that for making our project beautiful we used some image files like 

background_image.jpg - This image will be drawn in the background of our game window. 
Icon.png - This will be our icon for reset button. 
StartingImage.jpg - This image will be displayed everytime the game starts. 
   Note that we can decorate our window as much we can but here we just have to learn its working          and basic idea .
